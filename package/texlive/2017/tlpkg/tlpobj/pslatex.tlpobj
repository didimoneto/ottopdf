shortdesc Use PostScript fonts by default
longdesc A small package that makes LaTeX default to 'standard'
longdesc PostScript fonts. It is basically a merger of the times and the
longdesc (obsolete) mathptm packages from the psnfss suite. You must
longdesc have installed standard LaTeX and the psnfss PostScript fonts
longdesc to use this package. The main novel feature is that the pslatex
longdesc package tries to compensate for the visual differences between
longdesc the Adobe fonts by scaling Helvetica by 90%, and 'condensing'
longdesc Courier (i.e. scaling horizontally) by 85%. The package is
longdesc supplied with a (unix) shell file for a 'pslatex' command that
longdesc allows standard LaTeX documents to be processed, without
longdesc needing to edit the file. Note that current psnfss uses a
longdesc different technique for scaling Helvetica, and treats Courier
longdesc as a lost cause (there are better free fixed-width available
longdesc now, than there were when pslatex was designed). As a result,
longdesc pslatex is widely considered obsolete.
